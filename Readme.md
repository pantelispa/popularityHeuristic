# README

This paper is based on the analysis of data generated in agent-based simulations. Below we have some instructions on how to run the simulations to generate the data.

Simulations are written for R, base packages should be sufficient to run them, unless you want to run them on a cluster or multiple processors on a single computer. 
- State which packages (doSNOW), perhaps provide command to install them
- state approx time to generate them (on a given hardware)
- 


## Instructions for running simulations

state which file does what exactly...
Final-version6-3br.R = 

using makefile to automatize it...

implement something more replicable in terms of seeds...


## Licence

State under which licence usage of the code is allowed etc...

Bugs, comments etc should be communicated to: pantelispa@gmail.com
